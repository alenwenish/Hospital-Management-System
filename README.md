# Hsopital-Management-System
12th Grade case study project on Hospital Management System concept.

The project Hospital Management System (HMS) is for computerizing the working in a
hospital. It is a great improvement over the manual system. The computerization of the
system has speed up the process. In the current system, the front office managing is very
slow. It is an integrated end-to-end Hospital Management System that provides relevant
information across the hospital to maintain the patient’s record and it’s a seamless flow.

The system also stores the patient data in a well defined manner. The patient details include
his name, number, address and various health parameters and resources being used by them.
It also maintains all doctors information.

This will help the doctors or users to view the records of the patients immediately whenever
necessary. This software also has the ability to add, update and delete the record whenever
needed. This project will help to smoother the process of the hospital.
